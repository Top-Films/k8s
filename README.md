## Overview
This repository holds all of Top Films' Kubernetes files, including manifests and helm charts. Instructions can be found below for specific items.

## Prerequisites
- A MicroK8s Cluster
- Kubectl
- Helm

ðŸ’¡ Note that the commands used in the instructions contains aliases. You can use the following to add the alias's to your bash profile. If you are using Windows and Git Bash, disregard sudo.

```bash
# Add the following to your VMs or machines running MicroK8s
echo "alias k=\"sudo microk8s kubectl\"" >> .bashrc
echo "alias kubectl=\"sudo microk8s kubectl\"" >> .bashrc
echo "alias m=\"sudo microk8s\"" >> .bashrc
bash
```

## Raspberry Pi Prerequisites
1. Disable firewall

```bash
sudo ufw disable
```

2. Install Raspberry Pi extras

```bash
sudo apt install linux-modules-extra-raspi
```

3. Enable cgroups

```bash
sudo nano /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt

# Add the following to the end
cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_memory=1

# Reboot the node(s)
sudo reboot
```

## Creating a MicroK8s Cluster Ubuntu

1. Download install and run MicroK8s.

```bash
sudo snap install microk8s --classic
```

2. Expose the Kube API to external networks to connect from a different machine

ðŸ’¡ Note that this is not the most secure way to get access to a cluster from a local machine. If possible, VPN into the network running K8s.

```bash
# Navigate to the MicroK8s certs file
sudo nano /var/snap/microk8s/current/certs/csr.conf.template

# Add your external IP to the alt names
# i.e. IP.3 = xx.xx.xx.xx

# Refresh certificates
sudo microk8s refresh-certs --cert server.crt

# Display the config that you will copy to your local kube config
m config

# Change the value of server to either the external ip with the port 16443
# i.e. server: https://xx.xx.xx.xx:16443

# Verify it works with the following
k version
```

3. Add node(s)

```bash
# Run the following on the master node
m add-node

# Copy the command given and run it in a worker node that has MicroK8s installed
m join ...
```
